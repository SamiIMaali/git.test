# QR Code Component Challenge

This project was created as part of my learning journey with the **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** platform.
The challenge was to build a simple **QR Code component** using **HTML** and **CSS**, and make it look as close as possible to the given design.
