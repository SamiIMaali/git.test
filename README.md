# QR Code Component Challenge

This project was created as part of my learning journey with the **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** platform.
The challenge was to build a simple **QR Code component** using **HTML** and **CSS**, and make it look as close as possible to the given design.

It was built to practice basic front-end skills such as:

* Structuring HTML elements correctly
* Applying CSS styling and layout
* Centering elements on the page
* Using responsive design principles

## ðŸš€ Tools Used

* HTML5

* Visual Studio Code

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

The main goal of this project was to improve my understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals while following a real-world style challenge.
